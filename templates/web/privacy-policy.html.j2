                    <h4 class="subtitle"> Security Measures</h4>
                    <p class="text">We work hard to protect the security of your information by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the current standard for secure transactions over the Internet. There are some simple measures that you can take to promote protection of your information. First, to help protect the security of your account, do not share your password with others. Also, remember to "log-off" after using any of our on-line services when you have finished using the website/mobile app. While Green Decor strives to protect your information by using SSL and through measures to protect our system, such security cannot be ensured. Consequently, Green Decor does not ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.  </p>

                     <h5 class="subtitle"> What is Encryption?</h5>
                     <p class="text">Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble sensitive information while it is in transit to Green Decor.</p>
                     <p class="text">Please take a moment to read about the steps that we have taken to help protect your information and make your online transmissions safer. We also invite you to review the steps you can take to help protect yourself further.</p>
                     <h5 class="subtitle">How Does Encryption Work?</h5>
                     <p class="text">Encryption is based on a key that has two different parts. The public part and the private part. The public part of the key is distributed to those you want to communicate with. The private part is for the recipient's use only.</p>
                     <p class="text">When you send personal information to www.greendecor.in, you use Green Decor public key to encrypt your personal information. That means, if at any point during the transmission your information is intercepted, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once Green Decor receives your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of our key to decode it.</p>
                     <h5 class="subtitle">What Information Does Green Decor Encrypt?</h5>
                     <p class="text">Green Decor encrypts all personal information you give us when you place an order online. Remember, if you feel uncomfortable providing any of this information online, please feel free to call one of our representatives at +91-7838383755</p>
                     <h5 class="subtitle">How Safe is Encryption Really?</h5>
                     <p class="text">Providing encrypted information online is as safe as doing it over the phone. </p>
